Projects that I have completed through the online learning platform [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). Note that all project descriptions come straight from the Datacamp platform

### [Analyze International Debt Statistics](https://github.com/jingle77/DataCamp/tree/master/Analyze%20International%20Debt%20Statistics)

- In this project, you are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. You are going to find the answers to questions like:

  - What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
  - Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
  - What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

- The data used in this project is provided by The World Bank. It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015.

### [Analyze your Runkeeper Fitness data](https://github.com/jingle77/DataCamp/tree/master/Analyze%20Your%20Runkeeper%20Fitness%20Data)

- With the explosion in fitness tracker popularity, runners all of the world are collecting data with gadgets (smartphones, watches, etc.) to keep themselves motivated. They look for answers to questions like:

  - How fast, long, and intense was my run today?
  - Have I succeeded with my training goals?
  - Am I progressing?
   -What were my best achievements?
  - How do I perform compared to others?

- I exported seven years worth of my training data from Runkeeper. The data is a CSV file where each row is a single training activity. In this project, you'll create import, clean, and analyze my data to answer the above questions. You can then apply the same strategy to your training data if you wish!

### [Do left handed people really die young?](https://github.com/jingle77/DataCamp/tree/master/Do%20left%20handed%20people%20really%20die%20young)

- Barack Obama is left-handed. So are Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey and Babe Ruth and Marie Curie. A 1991 study reported that left-handed people die on average nine years earlier than right-handed people. Nine years! Could this really be true?

- In this project, you will explore this phenomenon using age distribution data to see if we can reproduce a difference in average age at death purely from the changing rates of left-handedness over time, refuting the claim of early death for left-handers. This notebook uses pandas and Bayesian statistics to analyze the probability of being a certain age at death given that you are reported as left-handed or right-handed.
